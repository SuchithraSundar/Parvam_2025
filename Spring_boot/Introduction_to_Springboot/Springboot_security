SpringBoot Security
===================
Spring Security is all about authentication and  authorization
	-->Authentication - who you are?
	-->Authorization - access or roles or promises

We can authenticate user in multiple ways:
=========================================
Username and password
JWT(json web tocken ) Tocken -
OAuth2.0 authentication i.e logging using google, GitHub, facebook account

By default spring security will provide user name and password authentication

1. For RestAPI spring boot, spring security will provide HTTPBasicAuthenticationn.

2. For MVC Architecture spring will provide formBasedAuthentication

For these two we will use username and password.
